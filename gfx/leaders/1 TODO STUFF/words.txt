important:

1. Basically for every character portrait we want to make a copy of that portait but for advisors.
2. Scale it to fit the Minister Base.png size.
3. Rename the new minister picture as "small_xxx", with the xxx being whatever name that was the original.
4. Save it as a .dds file in the same folder as the normal portraits.

optional:

1. update the current portraits in the mod to ahve the Leader Portrait Background for the portraits without a background already.
2. not actually neccessary but will look nicer than the current blank white background some portraits have.
3. I only added this because I know whoever doing this would be autistic enough to actually care and actually do it lmao.
