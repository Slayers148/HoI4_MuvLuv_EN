 1973_START_NAME:0 "BETA Invasion"
 1973_START_DESC:0 "Unplayable"
 1999_START_NAME:0 "Operation Lucifer"
 1999_START_DESC:0 "In the year 1999, Mankind stands at the brink of destruction. Having fought the BETA for nearly 30 years, humanity has lost control of much of the total landmass of Earth including almost the entirety of the Eurasian Continent. The Eastern advance of BETA, which began 9 years ago, has now reached the Japanese archipelago. If the BETA cannot be prevented from consuming yet another great nation the destruction of mankind will be inevitable."
 JAP_1999_START_DESC:0 "Japan has lost much of its territory and people to the Great BETA invasion in 1998. Through the sacrifice of many soldiers at the Emperor's Absolute Defense line over several months many were able to evacuate from the encroaching BETA horde but the BETA have now pushed into the Kanto region. To worsen matters, the BETA have reached Sadogashima and started constructing a hive there. Without the intervention and support of US and UNAF forces, the day when the Imperial city of Tokyo will fall may be near, and with it, the loss of Japan as a whole. "
 BET_1999_START_DESC:0 "BETA or Beings of Extra Terrestrial origin which is Adversary of the human race. An alien life-form that is hostile to humanity. First spotted on Mars in 1958, they arrived on the Moon in 1967 and, after a brief conflict with humanity's space forces, invaded Earth in 1973. As of 1999 they have conquered 90% of the Eurasian Continent and are threatening many remaining nations. Should their position of dominance on Earth remain without any form of counter offensive across the next few years little hope remains for the survival of Earth."
 USA_1999_START_DESC:0 "The United States is one of the few nations not to have been invaded by the BETA alongside being the only superpower of the same, and is the world's strongest country in 1999. Wielding an overwhelming total industrial power it contributes to the war effort through large export of weapons and leases of its industrial capacity to other nations around the world. However the extent of its production capabilities are stifled due to the lack of public support and apathy to the war. Should the true power of the US be unlocked the path to humanity’s victory may be opened."
 EUR_1999_START_DESC:0 "The European Union is a supranational union centered on the western countries of Europe. Established in 1972 as a military alliance it later evolved into a federal system. Due to the onslaught of the BETA continent of Europe by 1999 is almost completely controlled by the BETA. Only the British Isles and Sicily remain under human control. Following the loss of the majority of the continent the United Kingdom now serves as the headquarters for the EU at the forefront in the European theater. Having repulsed a major and crippling attempt of the BETA to cross the English Channel the Union has reorganized with the aim of recapturing Europe."
 SOV_1999_START_DESC:0 "The Soviet Union, once a superpower that fought against the United States, lost the vast majority of its land to the BETA by 1999, only clinging on to its far Siberian territories, forming a defense line on the Kamchatka Peninsula. Having been provided territory in Alaska through a lease from the USA the Union still remains a strong military and industrial power considered second only to the US. The Soviet Communist government is eager to recapture lost territory and overthrow the dominance of the United States."
 UNI_1999_START_DESC:0 "The United Nations Armed Forces were established by the Vancouver Agreement, which prohibits countries from fighting arbitrarily in the BETA War. Currently, it absorbs the troops of small countries destroyed by BETA to form a large army, but its influence on the world is still limited. If the United Nations provides great results, it may be possible to unite humanity under a single banner."
 AFR_1999_START_DESC:0 "Africa, the birthplace of mankind, has reached a major turning point in its history after Europe was ravaged by the BETA. Many nations exiled from the European continent have begun investing heavily in their former colonies in Africa. As a result of this investment in both industry and infrastructure the Africa members of the Union developed some of the largest cities in the world. The Union, having previously focused its attention on the Suez Absolute Defense Line, now plans to get rid of the BETA with African hands and put an end to every past wrong dealt to the people of Africa by the Europeans."
 CHI_1999_START_DESC:0 "At the beginning of the BETA's invasion of Earth, the People's Republic of China attempted to repel it with the aid of the Soviet Union. However following the emergence of the Laser class BETA the sole advantage of humanity was lost and the nation suffered a huge blow. The gradual loss of land forced the PRC to establish the United Front of China, a military and economic aid alliance, with the Republic of China on Taiwan in 1987. Though many question the UFC's strength due to the frequently arising problems between the differences between the two it is assured that Taiwan's will not fall easily."
 GEU_1999_START_DESC:0 "The Coalition of South East Asian Nation is a national alliance formed by the majority of the Far East countries except Japan and China. Initially, these nations individually joined the United Nations forces to fight the BETA. After losing their land, these highly motivated troops had no strong backing so they were preferentially sent to the forefront of the war. In order to correct this, a plan to form a national alliance emerged and as a result the Greater East Asia Union was formed."
 SOA_1999_START_DESC:0 "The South American Union is a supranational organization formed by the nations of South America in order to bolster their capabilities of fighting the BETA. However, a treaty with the USA have restricted their military capabilites."
 CEA_1999_START_DESC:0 "The Central American Alliance, much like the SAU, was formed in response to the BETA. However, its arms have also been limited due to a treaty with the United States of America."
 OSE_1999_START_DESC:0 "One of the few nations that have been largely unaffected by the BETA, Australia now boasts a high degree of food self-sufficiency due to a great increase in labor from refugees. However, the BETA approaches the Malayan peninsula and soon, Australia, if it does not contribute to COSEAN, will be at the frontlines of the conflict."
 CAN_1999_START_DESC:0 "Early on in the BETA conflict, Canada was struck by a concentrated nuclear attack which transformed the northeastern into a radioactive wastelahnd. Even with support from the United States, even 30 years after, much more needs to still be done to restore the nation."
 EEA_1999_START_DESC:0 "The Eastern European Socialist Coalition is composed of former Eastern European Warsaw Pact nations, with the German Democratic Republic as its nucleus. Currently, its power is limited after losing their mainland, and it is only able to provide military power as a EU observer nation."
