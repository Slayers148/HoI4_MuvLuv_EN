Most of our factories are used to process food or for export. We need to organize and simplify our production lines so that they can be used for military purposes as well. We will probably have to consolidate some private companies, but it is necessary."
 ose_eco2_1: "re-employment"
 ose_eco2_1_desc:0 "By consolidating the companies operating the food factories, surplus factories were created and a system was set up to establish munitions factories, but many of the refugees who had originally worked in the food factories became unemployed. However, many refugees who had originally worked in the food factories became unemployed, and they could not be left to fend for themselves until the factories restarted. Let's employ them in the military and train them for emergencies."

 ose_eco2_3: "AAX Project"
 ose_eco2_3_desc:0 "n recent years, the United States and other countries have begun to develop and deploy third-generation high-performance tactical aircraft, but Japan cannot afford to purchase such expensive tactical aircraft. However, our country cannot afford to buy such expensive tactical aircraft, and moreover, there is no way that we can have an aircraft that is considered a threat by the United States after the war. However, in order to counter the imminent threat of BETA, third generation tactical aircraft will be essential. In this context, the idea of asking the Bohning Corporation to develop an inexpensive third-generation aircraft came up."
 ose_eco2_4: "Factory overhaul"
 ose_eco2_4_desc:0 "Our country is one of the few countries in the world with a food self-sufficiency rate of over 100%, and synthetic foods, which are becoming more common in other countries, are not distributed at all. However, if we can meet our domestic demand with these, we will be able to use our food factories more freely."
 ose_eco2_5: "Large munitions workshop"

 ose_eco2_9: "Rely on the UN"

 ose_eco2_10: "an austeritarian lifestyle"
 ose_eco2_10_desc:0 "War is an imminent threat. The people of our country cannot live in peace. Let's enact laws that restrict our lives and curb our consumption."
 ose_eco2_11: "Naturalization of refugees"
 ose_eco2_11_desc:0 "In the past, refugees have been used as mere labor force, but thanks to them, our country has been able to make great strides. Now is the time to recognize them as citizens, working together in our country. Together, we can protect our country from BETA."
 ose_eco2_12: "Yuan Refugee Civilian Soldier System"
 ose_eco2_12_desc:0 "The naturalization of a large number of refugees has made it possible to apply conscription to them. We have always had volunteers, but by conscripting them, we will be able to greatly expand our military."
 ose_eco2_13: "payment"
 ose_eco2_13_desc:0 "The reforms that have been enacted in rapid succession have had a tremendous impact on the lives of the people. Let's focus on quelling the chaos by providing support money from the government and using the mass media to create publicity."
 ose_eco2_14: "A New Homeland"
 ose_eco2_14_desc:0 "There was some confusion, but the refugees were accepted to become Australian citizens. A number of refugee soldiers have also been assigned to the unit. Their determination to protect their new homeland has had a positive impact on the entire military."

 ose_war: "The Embryo of Innovation"
 ose_war_desc:0 "The Congress is calling for all possible measures to be taken to protect our country, but in the end there seems to be a widespread naiveté about converting existing food factories and accepting refugees little by little. If left to such soft-hearted people, our country will be overrun by BETA overnight. More radical reform is needed."
 ose_war3_1: "semi-forced labor law"
 ose_war3_1_desc:0 "The refugees in our country are forced to work for the government. In order to avoid blame, they will create a situation where the refugees have no choice but to do so by making it look like forced labor."
 ose_war3_2: "Focus on bombardment."
 ose_war3_2_desc:0 "Bombardment, it is the most important in anti-BETA warfare. In order to neutralize the laser class and kill them unilaterally, it is important to make the bombardment with AL rounds more efficient."
 ose_war3_3: "Tactical Research Institute"
 ose_war3_3_desc:0 "Our country has sent a very small number of dispatched troops to various places over the years, but the battle lessons gathered by those troops are not reflected in the entire military. Research on tactical aircraft is important, but without tactics, they will be useless."
 ose_war3_4: "Focus on tactical aircraft"
 ose_war3_4_desc:0 "Until now, we have been flattered by the United States and have not retained powerful tactical aircraft, but this is no longer the case. However, this is no longer the case. Japan must use all means at its disposal to acquire powerful tactical aircraft."
 ose_war3_5: "Focus on Tanks"
 ose_war3_5_desc:0 "Although they cannot fly, tanks can be deployed at high speed and are cheaper than tactical aircraft, making them essential equipment in the war against BETA. The expansion of these should also be hastened."
 ose_war3_6: "AL ammunition production plant"
 ose_war3_6_desc:0 "If we can mass produce AL ammunition in our country and supply it to other countries, we can increase our presence in the world and at the same time, we can increase the number of shell shields to protect our country. Let's build a dedicated factory and focus on production."
 ose_war3_7: "Focus on the Navy"
 ose_war3_7_desc:0 "Our country is not connected to the front lines by land. We should expand our navy and accelerate our research so that we can destroy BETA at sea."
 ose_war3_8: "Effective use of refugees"
 ose_war3_8_desc:0 "Refugees are arriving in our country every day. However, it is a waste of human resources to force all of them to work. We should improve the placement of human resources by conscripting ex-military personnel and forcing ex-university professors and teachers to work in research institutes."
 ose_war3_9: "Refugee Tank Factory"
